                <h1>Biography</h1>
				<p>Personal website: <a href="https://spestana.github.io/">spestana.github.io</a></p>
                <p>
                    Steven started work as a graduate student with the Mountain Hydrology Research group in Autumn 2017, and earned his Master’s degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2019. In his Master’s thesis, Steven demonstrated a bias-correction method for thermal infrared cameras used in airborne observations of snow and forest surface temperatures (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025699">Pestana et al., 2019</a>). 
				<p>
				</p>
					For his PhD work, Steven is currently investigating the use of infrared observations from NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) to observe components of the energy balance of mountain snow. 
				<p>
				</p>
					While at UW, he has also enjoyed the opportunity to teach and TA the “<a href="https://mountain-hydrology-research-group.github.io/data-analysis/">Data Analysis in Water Science</a>” course, as well as participate in and lead tutorials for UW eScience Institute <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/education/tutorials-and-bootcamps/">hackweeks</a>. These experiences have sparked an interest in critically examining and improving his own teaching and learning methods. 
				<p>
				</p>
					Python is Steven’s programming language of choice. He is continuing to learn about contributing to open science and software. 
				<p>
				</p>
					Steven enjoys birdwatching while exploring the mountains and forests of the Pacific Northwest, and stargazing when the night skies are clear. 
				<p>
				</p>
					Prior to starting at UW he worked on a NASA Applied Sciences DEVELOP project at JPL. He earned a B.S. in Geology, with a minor in Physics, from Cal Poly Pomona in 2015.
